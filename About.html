      My name is Steven Mungai Thuku. I'm 23 years old and I am an extrovert. I earned my stripes in Civil Engineering at Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Budapest Hungary, but now im kneedeep in the world of software development. I thrive on problem-solving and nailing down the nitty-gritty details,skills i picked up while designing real-worldstructures

    <p class="hobbies">
      When I'm not working on my computer, I'm all about the simple stuff. I really like movies, enjoy taking slow walks, get into the vibe of music, and I'm always ready for an adventure – whether it's checking out a new city or just finding a fresh playlist.
